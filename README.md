# Simple Bash completion for perlbrew

Perlbrew is a simple enough program that this is barely worth the effort.
However, I wanted to learn a bit more about Bash completion.

More importantly, this does offer one truly helpful feature. You can get
automatic prompting of all available installations of Perl (at least, all
the ones controlled by Perlbrew) by doing this:

    perlbrew switch [TAB][TAB]

This can be useful if you can't quite recall if you have `perl-5.12.3` or
`perl-5.13.2` (or both, or neither).
